# TweetChecker
A program that can be manipulated to scrape tweets and check their content for negative/positive words.


Utilizes Twint, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Beautiful Soup
The two text files contain 4,000+ words pertaining to negative/positive

You can maniuplate the code to change the twitter account, search critieria, and how the data is saved/exported.
Look at this for more information on that -------> https://github.com/twintproject/twint


Below you can see comparisons from the two graphs plotting exported date.
I compared the tweets from 1/12/22-1/24/22 between FOX and CNN that contained the word COVID.
